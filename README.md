# lexigraph

A thesaurus based vocabulary building application.

The application utilizes lexical relationships between a search word and its
synonyms (as pertained to each part-of-speech definition) to aid vocabulary
learning. 

In the lexigraph display mode, users can highlight to indicate words they
know, or dehighlight to indicate ones unknown. The application will refine its estimation
of user's presumed known words and automatically highlight them in all
subsequent searches.

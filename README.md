# LEXIGRAPH

Lexigraph is a full-stack thesaurus-based vocabulary building application. 

The application utilizes lexical relationships between a search word and its synonyms (as pertained to each part-of-speech definition) to aid vocabulary learning. 

In the lexigraph display mode, users can highlight to indicate words they know, or dehighlight to indicate ones unknown. The application will refine its estimation of user's presumed known words and automatically highlight them in all subsequent searches.

This is a three-week capstone project for CMU 15112: Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science, Fall 2018.
